                <p><strong>21: Conspiracy Theories</strong> (conspiracy [名] 阴谋;)</p>
<p>[00:02:05] Before we go into some of the <strong>weirdest</strong>([形] 怪异的; “weird” 的最高级;) ones out there, let’s just define exactly what they are, why people believe them, and why they can be so <strong>seductive</strong>([形] 诱人的; 有魅力的;).<br>[00:02:31] You probably know about the <strong>existence</strong>([名] 存在; 生存;) of conspiracy theories such as that the moon landing was <strong>faked</strong>(fake [名] 赝品; 假货; 冒充者; [动] 伪造; 假装; 冒充; [形] 假的; 冒充的; 伪造的;), that JFK was <strong>assassinated</strong>(assassinate [动] 暗杀; 行刺;) by the CIA, or that 9&#x2F;11 was <strong>an inside job</strong>(内部工作; 内部人员所为;).<br>[00:02:58] 29% of Americans, apparently, according to a recent survey, believe that there is a <strong>deep state</strong>(深层国家&#x2F;政府) working against President Trump.<br>[00:05:46] And while conspiracy theories used to be pretty <strong>niche</strong>([名] 合适的位置; 称心的职务; 商机; 生态位;) and would exist in <strong>forums</strong>(forum [名] 论坛; 讨论会;) and chat rooms deep in the <strong>recesses</strong>([名] 隐蔽处; 橱柜; [动] 休会; 把…放进橱柜;) of the internet, for a series of reasons they are now much more mainstream.<br>[00:06:17] Others <strong>attribute</strong>([动] 由…引起; 把…归因于; 认为是…创作的; [名] 属性; 品质; 特征; 定语; ) this to a lack of trust in government and the authorities.<br>[00:06:23] As people trust these kinds of institutions less and less, the more seductive it becomes to believe that there is some kind of great conspiracy that the government is <strong>engaged</strong>(engage [动] 参与; 从事; 吸引; 雇佣; 与…建立密切关系;) in against us, against normal people.<br>[00:06:40] While others blame politicians for <strong>fanning the flames</strong>(煽风点火;).<br>[00:06:45] When the President of the USA is a serial conspiracy theorist, this <strong>legitimates</strong>(legitimate [形] 合法化的; 合理的; 法律认可的; [动] 使合法; 认为正当;) a lot of beliefs which would previously not have been <strong>given the light of day</strong>(得到阳光的照耀).<br>[00:06:58] And while some conspiracy theories used to be sort of <strong>laughable</strong>([形] 可笑的; 逗人笑的;), the past few years have shown just how dangerous some of them can be.<br>[00:07:42] The restaurant owners, the owners of the pizza restaurant, were <strong>harassed</strong>(harass [动] 骚扰; 烦扰; 屡次侵扰;) by hundreds of people, and a 28 year old man turned up at the restaurant to ‘self-investigate’ with an <strong>assault</strong>([名] 攻击; 侵袭; 侵犯他人身体(罪); [动] 袭击; 突袭;) <strong>rifle</strong>([名] 步枪; 来福枪; [动] 快速搜寻;) and he fired three shots.<br>[00:07:59] The conspiracy theory has been completely <strong>debunked</strong>(debunk[动] 揭穿真相; 暴露;), proved to be completely false, and luckily nobody died, but <strong>evidently</strong>([副] 显然地;) it was pretty close.<br>[00:08:12] So these kinds of conspiracy theories can be really dangerous, and obviously I wouldn’t like to even give any <strong>airtime</strong>([名] 播放时间; 通话时间;) to any semi mainstream conspiracy theory.<br>[00:08:25] So today we are going to talk about three of the <strong>wackiest</strong>(wacky[形] 古怪的; 反常的; 滑稽可笑的; 疯疯癫癫的;), weirdest conspiracy theories out there.<br>[00:08:34] All of these aren’t a joke, there are people who really <strong>genuinely</strong>([副] 由衷地; 真诚地; 真正地;) believe them.<br>[00:08:40] So without further <strong>ado</strong>([名] 无谓的忙乱; 小题大做; 麻烦;), our first one, our first conspiracy theory is that dinosaurs built the <strong>pyramids</strong>([名] 金字塔; 棱锥体;).<br>[00:08:50] Yes. Dinosaurs, the species that most people acknowledge to have been made <strong>extinct</strong>([形] 灭绝的; 熄灭的; 绝种的;) about 65 million years ago.<br>[00:08:59] They are believed by some to have been <strong>tamed</strong>([动] 驯服; 使驯服; “tame” 的过去式和过去分词;), <strong>domesticated</strong>([形] 喜欢家庭生活的; 被驯养了的; [动] 驯养; 使爱家; 适应家庭生活;) by the <strong>ancient</strong>([形] 古代的; 古老的; [名] 古人;) <strong>Egyptians</strong>([名] 埃及人; 埃及语; [形] 埃及的; 埃及人的;) and to have built the pyramids.<br>[00:09:11] The reason for this is <strong>supposedly</strong>([副] 据说; 据推测;) that some texts were found that show images of dinosaur-type creatures building the pyramids, but the evidence seems to be pretty <strong>tenuous</strong>([形] 脆弱的; 稀薄的; 空洞的;).<br>[00:09:41] Secondly, and this is one that I quite like, there is a conspiracy theory that Disney made the film Frozen in order to distract attention from the other conspiracy theory that Walt Disney, the creator of Disney, was <strong>cryogenically</strong>([副] 低温地;) frozen.<br>[00:10:33] So some people believe that the reason the entire Frozen <strong>franchise</strong>([名] 特许经营权; 获特许经营权的商店; [动] 授予…特许经销权;) was created, and that it was called Frozen, was to fill up the search results with references to the actual film and not the conspiracy theory.<br>[00:11:29] If you aren’t familiar with <strong>Stonehenge</strong>([名] 巨石阵;), it’s the <strong>prehistoric</strong>([形] 史前的; 陈旧的;) monument in the English countryside with huge stones <strong>piled</strong>([名] 桩; 堆; 摞; [动] 堆放; 叠放;) up on each other. It’s estimated that it was constructed between 3000 and 2000 BC and <strong>archeologists</strong>([名] 考古学;) have no hard evidence actually for how these huge stones were lifted up on top of each other.<br>[00:12:35] We could of course go on all day with weird conspiracy theories, and if you Google conspiracy theories, it really is a internet rabbit <strong>warren</strong>([名] 兔子窝; 狭窄拥挤的街区;), you could just go on and on all day, but I think this is quite enough for today’s podcast.<br>[00:12:53] I will leave that up to you if you want to continue the hunt for conspiracy theories, but as I’ve warned you, it is a <strong>slippery</strong>([形] 滑的; 狡猾的;) <strong>slope</strong>([名] 斜坡; 坡度; [动] 倾斜; 有坡度;). So we will leave it there for today. </p>
<p><strong>23: Part 1: The Most Common Mistakes People Make When Learning English (and How to Avoid Them)</strong></p>
<p>[00:00:35] So it’s a slight <strong>deviation</strong>([名] 偏离; 出轨; 背弃) from our usual topics of weird and wonderful things that happen in the world.<br>[00:01:16] We aren’t going to be talking about <strong>specific</strong>([形] 具体的; 明确的; 特定的; [名] 特效药) mistakes people make, but rather <strong>strategic</strong>([形] 战略上的) mistakes <strong>in terms of</strong>([短语] 就…而言; 在…方面; 根据) the approach that you take when learning English.<br>[00:01:45] And if we talk about mistakes that you know that you don’t make, well, you can give yourself a little <strong>pat on the back</strong>([短语] 鼓励;).<br>[00:01:58] I’m certainly not, and don’t feel <strong>disheartened</strong>([动] 使沮丧气馁; 使灰心;) if you notice some of your own behaviour in some of the things that we’ll talk about today.<br>[00:02:26] As I was making my notes for this podcast, it became obvious that if I tried to <strong>squeeze</strong>([动] 捏; 榨; 挤 (进); [名] 捏; 榨; 挤;) everything into one podcast, well it would end up being quite long.<br>[00:04:10] Materials are often <strong>artificial</strong>([形] 人造的; 人工的; 假的;), <strong>staged</strong>([名] 阶段; 时期; 舞台; [动] 举行; 上演;) situations and they’re not really interesting at all.<br>[00:04:36] The result of this is that you can find yourself getting bored, you can’t <strong>motivate</strong>([动] 引起动机; 激发; 激励;) yourself and you can’t concentrate as well, and the study of language becomes a <strong>chore</strong>([名] 家务活; 杂事; 令人讨厌的或繁重的工作;), something boring to do, not a pleasure.<br>[00:05:04] Just read or listen to content that hasn’t been <strong>dulled</strong>([形] 愚笨的; 枯燥的; 感觉迟钝的; 无趣的; 阴暗的;) down specifically for language learners.<br>[00:05:12]Not just listening to staged conversations or boring small-talk where you aren’t actually learning anything <strong>over and above</strong>([短语] 过于; 除…之外; 另外;) language.<br>[00:06:14] Everyone learns at a different <strong>pace</strong>([名] 一步; 步伐; 步速; [动] 踱步; 调整步伐;) using different techniques and different things work for different people.<br>[00:06:51] It’s completely natural to want to <strong>engage</strong>([动] 参与; 从事; 吸引; 雇佣; 与…建立密切关系;) with other learners and understand how your progress compares to theirs.<br>[00:07:06] <strong>By all means</strong>([短语] 尽一切办法; 务必; 一定;), try out different <strong>tactics</strong>([名] 战术; 策略;), but you will find out what works for you and you shouldn’t be comparing yourself <strong>constantly</strong>([副] 不断地; 时常地;) to the progress of others.<br>[00:08:27] This is something that actually <strong>pains</strong>([名] 痛苦; 苦恼;) me to see, and it’s something that I see all the time with language learners.<br>[00:08:35] In the era of people thinking that there must be a hack, a shortcut for everything, a quick solution that means that you don’t need to put in the hours, this is becoming increasingly <strong>prominent</strong>([形] 突出的; 显著的; 杰出的;).<br>[00:09:33] Thinking about it like this is just <strong>framing</strong>([名] 框架; [动] 制定; 把…框起来; 陷害; “frame” 的现在分词;) it in completely the wrong way .<br>[00:09:38] Instead, you should <strong>embrace</strong>([动] 拥抱; 包围; 囊括; 接受; 信奉; [名] 拥抱;) the actual language learning process.<br>[00:09:47] Or to feel more <strong>at ease</strong>([短语] 安逸; 舒适; 自由自在;) in an English speaking country.<br>[00:10:08] Thinking of needing a hack makes language learning sound boring and <strong>tedious</strong>([形] 冗(rong3)长的; 沉闷的;), but it should be the opposite.<br>[00:10:17] <strong>Relish</strong>([动] 喜欢; 享受; 从…获得乐趣; [名] 享受; 乐趣; 调味品;) it and suddenly looking for <strong>elusive</strong>([形] 难以捉摸的; 不易被抓获 (察觉, 理解或记忆) 的;) hacks.<br>[00:10:32] Our next mistake, which is something that almost everyone suffers from to a certain <strong>degree</strong>([名] 度; 程度; 学位;), is the fear of making mistakes.<br>[00:10:42] Now I’m sure that you’ve heard this before, and being told, “don’t be afraid”, is about <strong>as useful as being hit in the face with a wet fish</strong>. So I will not <strong>patronise</strong>([动] 惠顾; 资助; 屈尊俯就;) you by saying that.<br>[00:13:00] I’ve got a good story here, which I think will be interesting and <strong>relevant</strong>([形] 相关的; 有意义的;) for a lot of you.</p>
<p><strong>24 Part 2: The Most Common Mistakes People Make When Learning English (and How To Avoid Them)</strong><br>[00:00:49] So if you haven’t listened to part one yet and that sounds <strong>right up your street</strong>(對（某人）的胃口，在（某人）的興趣範圍內), then go and give that a listen.<br>[00:01:23] Okay, mistake number six is a very common mistake that millions, tens, even hundreds of millions of English learners make, and that is to focus on grammar as a <strong>standalone discipline</strong>(独立的学科).<br>[00:01:38] Grammar in English has its easy parts, but like anything, it has its <strong>tricky bits</strong>(a bit tricky 有点棘手, 有点困难) too, and once you’ve covered the basics, the foundation of English grammar, the more complicated the grammar gets, the harder and more <strong>never-ending</strong>(永无止境, 没完没了) it can seem.<br>[00:03:01] You’ll remember from part one that our first mistake was to not focus on interesting content, and you would have to be a bit of a <strong>masochist</strong>([名] 受虐狂), slightly strange person if you were to classify grammar books as interesting content.<br>00:03:19] Yes, of course, it’s useful to have a base understanding of English grammar, how various words are <strong>conjugated</strong>([形] 共轭的), and so on.<br>[00:04:52] If you can embrace the <strong>quirkiness</strong>([名] ), the weirdness, the strangeness of English grammar, and stop worrying about learning it as a standalone discipline, then you’ll be amazed at how quickly you actually learn grammar. </p>
